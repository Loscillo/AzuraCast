  "body": "**AzuraCast** is a standalone, turnkey web radio management kit. Using its easy installer, you can go from a fresh Linux installation to a fully working web radio station in about 5 minutes. \r\n\r\n**AzuraCast is currently in alpha.** The web application is stable and includes a number of powerful features, but if you want to keep up to date with the latest version of the software, keep in mind that updates may cause unexpected issues or data loss. Always make sure to keep your files backed up, especially the files contained in `/var/azuracast/stations`.\r\n\r\nTo use AzuraCast, you should have a basic understanding of the Linux shell terminal. Once installed, every aspect of your radio station can be managed via AzuraCast's web interface with no advanced Linux knowledge required.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nWith AzuraCast, you can:\r\n\r\n* **Manage your Media:** Upload songs from the web, organize music into folders, and preview songs in your browser.\r\n* **Create Playlists:** Set up standard playlists that play all the time, scheduled playlists for time periods, or special playlists that play once per x songs, or once per x minutes.\r\n* **Set Up Live DJs:** Enable or disable live broadcasting from streamers/DJs, and create individual accounts for each streamer to use.\r\n* **Take Listener Requests:** Let your listeners request specific songs from your playlists, both via an API and a simple public-facing listener page.\r\n* **Analytics and Reports:** Keep track of every aspect of your station's listeners over time. View reports of each song's performance and\r\n* **Station Autopilot:** AzuraCast can automatically assign songs to a playlist based on the song's impact on listener numbers. \r\n* **Delegate Management:** Create and remove separate administrator accounts for each station manager.\r\n* ...and more.\r\n\r\n### Supported AutoDJ Software\r\n\r\nAzuraCast uses [LiquidSoap](http://liquidsoap.fm/) as an \"AutoDJ\" to shuffle songs and playlists and provide an always-online radio stream.\r\n \r\n### Supported Radio Frontends\r\n\r\nAzuraCast currently has modules to support these radio broadcasting services:\r\n* [IceCast](http://icecast.org/) v2.4\r\n* [ShoutCast](http://wiki.shoutcast.com/wiki/SHOUTcast_Broadcaster) v2.x\r\n\r\nYou can also use AzuraCast as a tool for syndicating remote stations. This allows you to take advantage of the powerful analytics and reporting tools in AzuraCast for any radio station that uses IceCast or ShoutCast 1 or 2.\r\n\r\n### Supported Operating Systems\r\n\r\nAzuraCast supports these operating systems and architectures out of the box:\r\n* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty) x64\r\n* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial) x64\r\n* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial) ARM\r\n\r\n## Installing AzuraCast\r\n\r\n### Installing on a Production Server\r\n\r\nAzuraCast is highly optimized for speed and performance, and can run on very inexpensive hardware, from the Raspberry Pi 3 to the lowest-level VPSes offered by most providers.\r\n\r\nSince AzuraCast installs its own radio tools, databases and web servers, you should always install AzuraCast on a \"clean\" server instance with no other web or radio software installed previously.\r\n\r\nAs the `root` user, execute these commands to set up your AzuraCast server:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\napt-get update\r\napt-get install -q -y git\r\n\r\nmkdir -p /var/azuracast/www\r\ncd /var/azuracast/www\r\ngit clone https://github.com/SlvrEagle23/AzuraCast.git .\r\n\r\nchmod a+x install.sh\r\n./install.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe installation process will take between 5 and 15 minutes, depending on your Internet connection. If you encounter an error, let us know in the [Issues section](https://github.com/SlvrEagle23/AzuraCast/issues).\r\n\r\nOnce the terminal-based installation is complete, you can visit your server's public IP address (`http://ip.of.your.server/`) to finish the web-based setup.\r\n\r\n#### Updating\r\n\r\nAzuraCast also includes a handy updater script that pulls down the latest copy of the codebase from Git, flushes the site caches and makes any necessary database updates. Run these commands as any user with `sudo` permissions:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd /var/azuracast/www\r\n\r\nchmod a+x update.sh\r\n./update.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Local Development with Vagrant\r\n\r\nTo make local development and testing easier, AzuraCast also includes the necessary configuration to set up a Vagrant box on your computer.\r\n\r\nSee [the AzuraCast Wiki](https://github.com/SlvrEagle23/AzuraCast/wiki/Developing-Locally) for detailed instructions on the installation process.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\nTake a look at samples of the AzuraCast interface on the [Screenshots](https://github.com/SlvrEagle23/AzuraCast/wiki/Screenshots) page on the Wiki.\r\n\r\n## AzuraCast API\r\n\r\nOnce installed and running, AzuraCast exposes an API that allows you to monitor and interact with your stations.\r\n\r\nDocumentation about this API and its endpoints are available on the [AzuraCast APIary Documentation](http://docs.azuracast.apiary.io/).\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nAzuraCast is licensed under the [Apache license, version 2.0](https://github.com/SlvrEagle23/AzuraCast/blob/master/License.txt).\r\n\r\n## Questions?
